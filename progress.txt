basicMatrixMult is done
  overally good

elementwise based mult is done
  performance?
  speed?

random projection is tested:
  fjlt and tug-of-war have bad performance
  2014paper has good
  2014paper is too slow as it need to compute svd, unless an approximation is added
  need to go through the code and check again

fft based tested and done:
  error too high, errnorm/ab_norm is around 5

nystrom tested and done:
  related to parameter k, it seems if k = n/100 is as good as n/10, can try log n to test

cs based tested and done:
  very slow using l1magic
  don't know how to use capital C and small c, because gamma is coresponding to some capital C
  accuracy is good
