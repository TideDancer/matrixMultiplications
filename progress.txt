basicMatrixMult is done
  overally good

elementwise l2 mult is tested and done
  parameter l is too small with normal or uniform matrix, which result in bad performance
  because n/l is related to epsilon thus not satisfying epsilon
  speed is fast

random projection is tested and done
  fjlt tested and checked and done, bad performance, err/ab = 1e^4
  tug-of-war have bad performance, err/ab = 10
  2014paper has good performance, err/ab = 1e-3. 2014paper is too slow as it need to compute svd, unless an approximation is added
  2009paper using sign matrix is overally good performance and speed. 

fft based tested and done:
  error too high, errnorm/ab_norm is around 5

nystrom tested and done:
  related to parameter k, it seems if k = n/100 is as good as n/10, can try log n to test

cs based tested and done:
  very slow using l1magic
  don't know how to use capital C and small c, because gamma is coresponding to some capital C
  accuracy is good

linear equation tested and done:
  speed and accuracy ok
  therotically has problem, why n^2
