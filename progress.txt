basicMatrixMult is done
  overally good

elementwise based mult is done
  performance?
  speed?

random projection is tested:
  fjlt and tug-of-war have bad performance
  2014paper has good
  2014paper is too slow as it need to compute svd, unless an approximation is added
  need to go through the code and check again
